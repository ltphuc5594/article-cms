### I would like to choose an App Service in this project.
- *It is lightweight web application, so it is suitable App Service over VMs.*
- *And this application is a CMS system, is used for internal user. So the number of users is not large.*
- *App Services cost less than VMs do*
- *The app service is a PaaS option, it supports continuous deployment model using GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo*
- *App Services supported multiple languages includes Python*
